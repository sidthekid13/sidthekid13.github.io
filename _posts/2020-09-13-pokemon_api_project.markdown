Greetings! 

For my API project i decided to go with the https://pokeapi.co/ as my external source to create my own API for this project. I originally started out with a different external source and a different topic, but ran into some difficulties. I ran into quite a few problems through out creating this API but in the end was able to get through it and build an API that worked! 

My API that I created uses data from the external source that i chose and it allows the user to interact with it. the first thing that my API will do is greet the user and then print off a list of pokemon. Next, it will allow the user to select any of the following pokemon to learn more about it! Once the user has selected a pokemon, the API will return the name of the pokemon and more information about the pokemon that was chosen.

After a pokemon has been selected and information about that pokemon has been returned, the API will then ask you if you would like to select another pokemon. Then the user can type, yes or no, if they would like to view another pokemon. if the user inputs "yes", it will prompt you to input another number for a pokemon on the list. If the user decides to input "no", the program will then say "See ya later!" and exit out of the program!

It took lots of trial and error to eventually get my API to work, but with the help from some of my fellow Cohort classmates, I was able to work through it and create a code for an API that worked!
