For my Sinatra Portfolio Project I decided to make a program that could let the user log and write about books that they have read. I call it the "Library Log"! It allows the user to sign up with a username, email, and a password. Then the user can log in and create new posts, edit their posts, or delete their posts. 

This project was at times quite difficult for me and i definitely learned a lot about how to create a program that a user can interact with. Some of the biggest challenges i faced was trying to solve errors. I had a few errors that took quite a while to solve but eventually I was able to find where the error was coming from and end the end i was able to create a project that worked and ran how I wanted it to!
